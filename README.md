# Turing Split - HIGHWAY

I type a lot. Like, an insane amount. I write code for my robotics team and a lot for Hack Club, so I need a decent keyboard.
I've been using the Apple Magic Keyboard for a long while, and it's honestly quite nice. I originally bought it because my Quest 2 can track it.

However, I also am prone to carpal tunnel and other hand/fingie-issues, so I figured I should get a keyboard.
This led me to a discovery: Keyboards, are not cheap.

Then I discovered Highway and had a thought: make someone else pay for my keyboard.

### my keyboard design

I was tempted to go all out and build a full desk size keyboard contraption, but then I found [ergogen](https://ergogen.ceoloide.com/?exp=kicanvas) and decided to make an ergonomic, split-deck keyboard.
I based this off of a lot of random keyboards I saw throughout the internet and had one main focus when designing: comfortable, but not confusing.

I like layers. I plan to use them. I also want to have enough buttons I can do things easily and without thinking. If I wanted chords, I would have made a stenography keyboard.

This isn't the most complicated design, it's not the most simple, but it is mine, and I feel happy with it.
