# May 23: The Beginning
I've decided to make a custom split-deck keyboard because I have large hands and my current keyboard doesn't really work well for long programming sessions.

I'm using a software called Ergogen to help design the keyboard because its effectively parametric (and I don't know enough about pcb design to do it fully in kicad lol).

It's going good.

As of 2:33 pm, time spent is 4 hours.
